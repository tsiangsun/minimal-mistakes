Albert Einstein once said, "The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all comprehensible".
 I believe this statement reflects the original curiosities of most physical scientists, including myself. My priority is to stimulate students'
  curiosity of natural sciences, by making it easier for them to understand while still providing a broad picture of the field, so as to prepare them for their future careers in an ever-growing multidisciplinary working environment. Specifically, in physical chemistry and related courses, students will develop a _scientific mindset_ to approach and solve chemical problems in a systematic manner with universal concepts and principles.
