Advisor: Eitan Geva  
Project: Photo-induced charge transfer dynamics via the linearized semiclassical method.  
The linearized semiclassical (LSC) approximation provides a flexible, rigorous and self-consistent framework for developing computationally feasible methods, capable of capturing important quantum effects in complex many-body systems described in terms of anharmonic force fields, such as organic photovoltaic materials. The LSC approximation corresponds to linearizing the forward-backward action, with respect to the difference between the forward and backward paths, in the exact path integral expressions for quantities under consideration. This results in useful and flexible prescriptions that allow one to account for quantum effects based on classical-like inputs. We have developed a hierarchy of LSC-based approaches for simulating photo-induced charge transfer dynamics within the framework of equilibrium and nonequilibrium Fermi’s golden rule, mixed quantum-classical Liouville dynamics, and the generalized quantum master equation. LSC will be shown to yield the quantum-mechanically exact equilibrium and nonequilibrium Fermi’s golden rule charge transfer rates when the donor and acceptor surfaces are shifted but otherwise identical Marcus parabolas. LSC will also be shown to give rise to mixed quantum-classical Liouville dynamics upon linearization of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Finally, LSC can also be used for calculating the memory kernel of the generalized quantum master equation. The feasibility, accuracy and robustness of LSC-based methods will be demonstrated via applications to model systems ranging from electronic transitions through conical intersections in gas phase molecules to charge transfer dynamics based on realistic molecular models of donor-bridge-acceptor systems in liquid solution. 
* Visiting Scientist, Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 2014.  
Advisor: Branka M. Ladanyi   
Project: Structure, dynamics and solvation in heterogeneous environments.  
Performed molecular dynamics simulation of dye Coumarin 153 in acetonitrile, and constructedthe effective molecular polarizability model for ground and first excited solute from the input of abinitio quantum chemistry calculations. Demonstrated that the polarizability of the excited solute onthe solute-pump/solvent-probe spectroscopy reflect the change of solution dynamics upon thephoto-excitation of the solute.
* Graduate Research Assistant, Department of Chemistry, Brown University, 2009-2014.  
Advisor: Richard M. Stratt  
Project: Developing a molecular theory for solute-pump/solvent-probe spectroscopy.   
The experiment has been done in Norbert Scherer’s group, whose setup is a resonant electronic solute-pump followed by a nonresonant transient grating. Until recently, this spectroscopy lacked a molecular understanding about what it can tell us about solvation dynamics. We developed the linear response theory for it and tested the theory in the problem of preferential solvation dynamics with the help of molecular dynamics simulation. We thought that this spectroscopy would give similar information on solvation dynamics as in a time-dependent fluorescence study. But we discovered that the 2D spectra can tell us about the nonequilibrium structural dynamics of the solvents near the newly excited solute. This information is different from the solute-solvent interaction energetic dynamics measured in a time-dependent fluorescence experiment.
